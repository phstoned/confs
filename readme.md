Packages and tools I found very useful

* [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

  Best search speed, used both in vim ctrl-p, and simple search via terminal
  **Usage**
  ```
  ls / | ag 'myname'
  ```
  
* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org)

  Make your terminal fun again (Will be default in new macos Catalina)

  **Quick install**
  ```
  brew install zsh
  # make default shell
  sudo -s 'echo /usr/local/bin/zsh >> /etc/shells' && chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh    
  ```
  
* [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

  Many useful packages, browse /plugins

* [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

  Vim package manager like bundler for ruby

* [Diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)

  Better git diff with syntax highlight

* [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  
  Better cat command with syntax highlight
